    content: "I met Ms. Chandralekha speech therapist, at last December. My son is diagnosed with intellectual disability. I am giving speech therapy for my son from 2 1/2 years with several therapists. I never met such good therapist ever before. She is wonderful therapist and she is having a good patience. She is taking every classes with interest and she is monitoring how we are doing at home also. Ms Chandralekha gave me good counselling for my son's progress and future development. She gave me an open talk about his development and future. My son is getting better progress. I hope he will speak soon. Thank you Chandralekha madam. I am very thankful to Ms. Lakshmi madam psychologist, who referred you. Thank you once again",
